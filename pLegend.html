    <center><h2>LEGEND</h2>
	<h3><i>Maria Makiling</i></h3></center>
<p>Maria Makiling is a well-known Filipino legend about a mystical goddess or diwata who guards Mount Makiling. She is described as a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair, kind to the people, and often seen walking through the forests. According to the legend, she helped those in need by providing food, crops, and even healing the sick. However, she remained unseen most of the time, only revealing herself when necessary.<br>

<p>Many versions of the legend tell of Maria Makiling’s love for a mortal man. In one version, she falls in love with a farmer or a hunter, but their love is forbidden or betrayed, causing her to retreat into the mountain and never be seen again. Some say she was heartbroken when the man she loved married another, while others believe she was angered by the greed and cruelty of the villagers. After she disappeared, her blessings stopped, and the once-fertile lands around Mount Makiling became barren.<br>

<p>To this day, many believe that Maria Makiling still watches over the mountain. Some say that lost travelers are guided back by a mysterious woman, while others claim to see her shadowy figure among the trees. The legend of Maria Makiling serves as a reminder to respect nature and value kindness, as well as a warning about the consequences of betrayal and greed.</p>
