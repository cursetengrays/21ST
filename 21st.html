  <a href="pre.html"> <h2> PRE-COLONIAL PERIOD </h2> </a>
  <p> All literary works during this period such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are mostly oral traditions.
      This is due to the unavailability of printing materials. During pre-colonial period, life was simple and so was literature. </p>

  <a href="japan.html"> <h2> JAPANESE PERIOD (1941 - 1945) </h2> </a>
  <p> Philippine literature was interrupted in its development when another foreign country, Japan, conquered the Philippines.
      Philippine literature in English came to a halt. This led to all newspapers not to be circulated in the community except for
      TRIBUNE and PHILIPPINE REVIEW.

  <a href="post.html"> <h2> POST-COLONIAL PERIOD (1945 - present) </h2> </a>
  <p> During this time, literature focused on themes of national identity, the dual perspectives of colonialism, and 
      using fiction as a means to address social issues and protest politics indirectly. Major works highlighted the 
      sacrifices of the Filipino people under Spanish, American and Japanese rule and the search for national identity 
      independent from foreign influences.
